Some countries are able to keep the situation under control, while some suffer the devastating effects from it. Among Asia countries, Indonesia has the highest COVID related mortality and positive rates for COVID-19 cases (Worldometers, n.d.), mainly in Jakarta, the main capital. This is likely due to certain underlying common factors within the countries. Researchers claimed that Jakarta could have as many as 4.7 million people who are possibly infected by the virus in March 2021 (Sood, 2021). This is alarming as this number constitutes to “nearly half” of Jakarta’s population. After our group was made aware about the seriousness of this matter, we decided to come up with Regressors, a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) application, to investigate the impacts of various variables (independent variable) on the mortality and positive rates (dependent variable).\r\nThis application aims to allow users to import a dataset of their preference and use it to identify the relationship between the selected independent variables, such as proximity to healthcare facilities and proximity to attraction, and the dependent variable, such as Number of positive COVID cases. Functions include Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), GWR, GWR prediction model. EDA visualizes the different variables on spatial point map and Histogram. GWR builds a GWR model based on selected dependent and independent variables, provides analysis on their relationship, thus allowing users to select the best parameters for the GWR base model. Additionally, users are able to visualize the accuracy of the model geographically. GWR prediction model is built based on selected dependent and independent variables with the dataset provided. The output is the predicted values which will be analyzed and visualized geographically on the interactive map.\r\nLinks\r\nGithub\r\nProject Proposal\r\nPoster\r\nResearch Paper\r\nUser Guide for ShinyApp\r\nShinyApp.io\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Some countries have been able to keep the situation under control, however, there are some that suffered more devastating effects from it. India and Indonesia are 2 countries in Asia that have the highest COVID related mortality and positive rates (Worldometers, n.d.) for COVID-19 cases, especially so in the main capital of the respective countries, likely due to certain underlying common factors within the countries.\r\nResearchers claims that Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta, could have as many as 4.7 million people who are possibly infected by the virus in March 2021 (Sood, 2021). This is alarming as this number constitutes to “nearly half” of Jakarta’s population.\r\nProject Objective\r\nOur research would focus on identifying the factors that may have played a part in Jakarta’s high infection rate, how much each factor contributes to the rates itself and how much of the infection rate can be explained by these factors, before applying the same model onto other countries to verify our observations.\r\nDatasets\r\nIndonesia Monthly Covid Data\r\nDescription: The data contain COVID-19 measures at sub-district level.\r\nFile Format: Excel\r\nVariables: ID_KEL, Nama_provinsi, nama_kota, nama_kecamatan, nama_kelurahan, POSITIF, Meninggal\r\nSource: https://riwayat-file-covid-19-dki-jakarta-jakartagis.hub.arcgis.com/\r\nIndonesia Population Density / Counts 2020\r\nDescription: The datasets contain population density / total number of people in Indonesia per grid-cell, at resolution of 30 arc (approximately 1km).\r\nFile Format: TIF\r\nSource: https://www.worldpop.org/\r\nIndonesia Birth 2015\r\nDescription: The data contain numbers of live births per grid square in Indonesia, at resolution of 30 arc (approximately 1km).\r\nFile Format: TIF\r\nSource: https://www.worldpop.org/\r\nBatas Desa Provinsi DKI Jakarta\r\nDescription: This is the geospatial data of DKI Jarkarta.\r\nFile Format: Shapefile\r\nVariables: OBJECT_ID, KODE_DESA, DESA, KODE, PROVINSI, KAB_KOTA, KECAMATAN.

The number of bins is to help group the data according to the values. Additionally, histogram is a efficient way to look at the skewness of the data distribution.\r\nIn this example, PROX_ATTRACTION is slightly right skewed, however, no action is required for our application to work.\r\nGWR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSelect dependent variable (Note: The correct dependent variable must be selected if not the system will have error)\r\nSelect 1 or more independent variables to analyze the relationships (Note: Select only numeric variables, do not select geometry and select at least 2 independent variables if a correlation analysis is desired)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that all parameters for “Correlation Plot” and “Model” have a default value as shown above. Not changing the selection will run the correlation and model analysis based on the selected parameters.\r\nCorrelation Plot (Step 1 to 3)\r\nSelect Order (AOE, FPC, hclust. alphabet)\r\nSelect Method (circle, square, ellipse, number, shade, color, pie)\r\nSelect Type (full, upper, lower)\r\nIf there are no changes to model parameters, click “Run” (Step 8)\r\nModel (Step 4 to 8)\r\nSelect Bandwidth (Fixed, Adaptive)\r\nSelect Approach (Cross Validation(CV), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC))\r\nSelect Kernel (Gaussian, Exponential, Bisquare, Tricube, Boxcar)\r\nSelect Distance metric (Euclidean, Great Circle)\r\nApply the changes in parameters to the model\r\nFormula Tab\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe formula tab shows the Multiple Linear Regression Formula based on the dependent and independent variables selected.\r\nIn this example, The formula is: POSITIF ~ PROX_ATTRACTION + PROX_WORSHIP + PROX_RESTAURANT\r\nCorrelation Plot Tab\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this tab, the correlation between selected dependent variables are shown with the diagonal always equating to 1 as a variable will always be correlated with itself. From the graph, the darker the colors are, the more the variables are correlated regardless of whether it is positive or negative.\r\nIn this example, the correlation plots shows the correlation coefficient between the 3 variables, PROX_ATTRACTION, PROX_WORSHIP, PROX_RESTAURANT. PROX_ATTRACTION can be inferred to be more correlated to PROX_RESTAURANT than with PROX_WORSHIP.\r\nSummary Tab\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Summary Tab, the statistical summary of the base model is shown. Some of which includes: Min, Median, Max, Statistical significance of variables in the model, the R-square value of the model. Based on the calculated p-value of each selected dependent variable, users can decide which variables to keep in the model.\r\nIn this example, we can interpret the multicollinearity function to be as such: POSITIF = 1822.98 + 185.89 * PROX_ATTRACTION + 69.32 * PROX_WORSHIP + 362.23 * PROX_RESTAURANT\r\nThe R-squared refers to the percentage that the regression model is able to explain. In this case, the R-squared is 0.1944 and it means that the multiple regression model built is able to explain about 19% of the number of POSITIF COVID-19 cases.\r\nThe model p-value tells us if the multiple linear regression model is a good estimator of the dependent variable. P-value lower than the significance level means multiple linear regression model is a good estimator of the dependent variable. P-value higher than the significance level means that the mean is a good estimator of the dependent variable.\r\nThe p-value of the above model is much smaller than 0.05, and hence we will reject the null hypothesis that mean is a good estimator of POSITIF. We can infer that the multiple linear regression model is a good estimator of POSITIF cases.\r\nCoefficients section shows the p-values of the estimates of the Intercept and the independent variables. Variables with p-value less than the significance level (can look at the asterick depending on the significance level determined by the user) means that they are good parameter estimates, which should be kept. On the other hand, variables with p-value above significance level (can look at the asterick depending on the significance level determined by the user) means they are not statistically significant and should be removed from the model.\r\nThe above shows that PROX_ATTRACTION and PROX_RESTAURANT are statistically significant and should be kept.\r\nMulticollinearity Tab\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe multicollinearity tab shows the VIF value of each independent variable\r\nIndependent variables with VIF more than 10 should be removed because there are signs of multicollinearity. In the example above, there is no sign of multicollinearity among the independent variables.\r\nLinearity Tab\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Linearity tab shows a plot of the model’s scaled residual centering around a zero line. A scatter plot clustering near the zero line indicates close approximation to linearity function.\r\nIn this example, we can see that most of the points are close to the zero line with a minority scattering across the lower and upper extremes of the graph, the model can therefore be considered to be approximately linear.\r\nNormality\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Normality tab shows the distribution of the model’s residual. It is desired to have the curve to closely resemble a normal curve as an indication for normality approximation.\r\nIn this example, we can see some resemblance of a normal curve, even though the curve is considered flat. This means that the model fulfils the normality assumption.\r\nBase Model’s Performance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Base Model’s Performance tab, the statistical summary of the global regression model and the GWR model are provided, as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the summary given in this example, we can see that the global regression model’s R-squared value is extremely low as compared to that of the GWR model. As R-squared value indicates how much of the data can be explained by the model, it may be worth considering to include more variables for better explainability of the model.\r\nVisualization\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this Visualization tab, the distribution of the local_R2 score is shown geographically, with darker shades indicating higher local_R2, thus better explainability of the model, while lighter shades indicate poorer explainability.\r\nIn this example, we can see that there are signs of clustering based on the local R-squared values, this may indicate that in certain areas, the dependent variable tend to have stronger relations to the selected independent variable\r\nData Table\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe data table tab shows the data of the selected dependent and independent variables.\r\nPrediction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSelect Dependent Variable (Note: The correct dependent variable must be selected if not the system will have error)\r\nSelect Two or More Independent Variables (Note: Select only numeric variables and do not select geometry)\r\nSelect Bandwidth (Fixed/Adaptive)\r\nSelect Approach (Cross Validation (CV) /Akaike Information Criterion (AIC))\r\nSelect Kernel (Gaussian/Exponential/Bisquare/Tricube/Boxcar)\r\nSelect Distance metric (Euclidean/Great Circle)\r\nCheck/Uncheck data table to show/unshow data table\r\nSelect “Run” button to see prediction\r\nFormula Tab\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe formula tab shows the Multiple Linear Regression Formula based on the dependent and independent variables input.\r\nIn this example, The formula is: POSITIF ~ PROX_ATTRACTION + PROX_WORSHIP + PROX_RESTAURANT + PROX_MALL + PROX_SUPERMARKET + PROX_CONVENIENCE + PROX_KINDERGARTENS + PROX_SCHOOL + PROX_TERMINAL + PROX_HEALTHCARE + PROX_RAILWAYS\r\nSummary Tab\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summary tab shows the summary of the linear regression model of the formula.\r\nWith the estimate of each coefficient we are able to formulate the linear regression formula. The summary shows that the number of POSITIF COVID-19 cases can be explained by using the formula:\r\nPOSITIF = 1861.21 + 242.39(PROX_ATTRACTION) + 36.22(PROX_WORSHIP) + 405.32(PROX_RESTAURANT) + 132.49(PROX_MALL) - 11.06(PROX_SUPERMARKET) - 30.83(PROX_CONVENIENCE) - 183.96(PROX_KINDERGARTENS) + 45.30(PROX_SCHOOL) - 13.63(PROX_TERMINAL) - 236.01(PROX_HEALTHCARE) + 57.90(PROX_RAILWAYS)\r\nThe R-squared refers to the percentage that the regression model is able to explain. In this case, the R-squared is 0.2296 and it means that the multiple regression model built is able to explain about 23% of the number of POSITIF COVID-19 cases.\r\nThe model p-value tells us if the multiple linear regression model is a good estimator of the dependent variable. P-value lower than the significance level means multiple linear regression model is a good estimator of the dependent variable. P-value higher than the significance level means that the mean is a good estimator of the dependent variable.\r\nThe p-value of the above model is much smaller than 0.05, and hence we will reject the null hypothesis that mean is a good estimator of POSITIF. We can infer that the multiple linear regression model is a good estimator of POSITIF cases.\r\nCoefficients section shows the p-values of the estimates of the Intercept and the independent variables. Variables with p-value less than the significance level (can look at the asterick depending on the significance level determined by the user) means that they are good parameter estimates, which should be kept. On the other hand, variables with p-value above significance level (can look at the asterick depending on the significance level determined by the user) means they are not statistically significant and should be removed from the model.\r\nThe above shows that PROX_ATTRACTION, PROX_RESTAURANT, PROX_MALL, PROX_HEALTHCARE and PROX_RAILWAYS are statistically significant and should be kept.\r\nPrediction Model’s Performance Tab\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prediction tab shows the result of GW prediction with the model. It shows the min, median and max of the predicted values.\r\nFrom the example, the min predicted POSITIF COVID-19 case is 1017.2, median predicted POSITIF COVID-19 case is 2602.7, and max predicted POSITIF COVID-19 case is 6208.4.\r\nVisualization Tab\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe visualization tab shows an interactive map of the predicted value geographically. Darker shade dot means a high prediction value while lighter shade dot means a low prediction value.\r\nThe above example shows the predicted POSITIF COVID-19 cases geographically in Jakarta. Region with darker shade dot means a high number of predicted POSITIF COVID-19 cases while region with lighter shade dot means a low number of predicted POSITIF COVID-19 cases.\r\nData Table\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe data table tab shows the data of the selected dependent and independent variables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
